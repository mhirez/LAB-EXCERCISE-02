## Project Overview

This project is a Java-based **Assignment Tracker** application designed to manage a list of homework assignments. The application allows users to add, remove, and complete assignments while keeping track of their due dates. It also provides functionality to display the assignments in the order they were assigned and to find the assignment(s) with the earliest due date.

### Features

1. **Add New Assignments**  
   - Users can add assignments with titles, descriptions, and due dates (including optional time).

2. **Remove Assignments**  
   - Users can remove individual assignments by title or multiple assignments at once.

3. **Complete Assignments**  
   - Marks an assignment as completed by removing it from the list.

4. **Show All Assignments**  
   - Displays a list of all assignments in the order they were assigned, highlighting overdue assignments.

5. **Show Earliest Assignment**  
   - Finds and displays the assignment with the earliest due date.

### Code Structure

- **Main Class (`LabExercise02`)**  
  Contains the main method that demonstrates the usage of the assignment tracker by adding, removing, and displaying assignments.
  
- **`AssignmentsApp` Class**  
  Implements all core features including adding, removing, completing, and displaying assignments.  
  The class uses a `PriorityQueue` to manage assignments based on their due dates.
